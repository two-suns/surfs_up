# Surfs Up Surf Shop
## Overview of Analysis  
W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.
## Results
### June Temperature Data

  * The average temperature is very mild at 74.94째 F.
  * The standard deviation is low, 3.26, signifing there are no extreme outliers.
  * The mean and median are essentially the same, so the distribution should be symmetrical.

### December Temperature Data

  * The average temperature is slightly lower at 71.04째 F.
  * The standard deviation is again low, 3.75, so no significant outliers appear present.
  * The distribution is more symmetrical again with the median only .04째 less than the mean.

## Summary
The results of the temperature analysis show that the temperatures are very consistent throughout the months of June and December. The majority of values are around the mean without any extreme outliers.  With only an approximately 3째 drop in temperature in December, it appears the temperatures should be fairly consistent throughout the year.  This means the surf and ice cream shop should perform well year-round.  

However, temperature is not the only thing that would cause a drop in sales.  Another query that should be performed is for the amount of precipitation measured.  If it is raining for most of a month, it likely would not matter how nice the temperature is. Finally, another query that could be performed is to find the weather station with the most observations to ensure enough data points are being used for the analysis.
